Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially examines each element of an array or list until it finds the desired element or reaches the end of the dataset.

## Example

1. Start with the first element of the array.
2. Compare the target element with the current element of the array:
   - the elements are equal, we return the index of that element.
   - If the elements are not equal, we move to the next element.
3. The process repeats until the element is found or the end of the array is reached.

Letâ€™s consider an example where we search for the number `8` in the following array of numbers:

```java
[17, 14, 9, 8, 7, 16, 24, 22, 3]
```

Compare the target with the first element.

```java
[->17<-, 14, 9, 8, 7, 16, 24, 22, 3]
17 != 8 // Move to the next element
```

Compare the target with the second element.

```java
[17, ->14<-, 9, 8, 7, 16, 24, 22, 3]
14 != 8 // Move to the next element
```

Repeat the process of iterating over the array and comparing each element until the target element is found.

## Java Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
        int target = 7;

        int result = linearSearch(numbers, target);
        // result == -1 means number not found
        // result != -1 means number found and the result is an index of this element
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Best case: `O(1)`
- Worst case: `O(n)`

## Advantages

- Simple implementation.
- Works on sorted and unsorted datasets.
- Can be used on any data structure (arrays, lists etc.).
- Does not require additional memory or data structures.

## Disadvantages

- Slow for large datasets.
- Searches each element sequentially, even if the data is sorted.
- Performance decreases significantly as the dataset size increases.

## Usage

- **Small datasets**: ideal when performance differences are negligible.
- **Unsorted data**: works well without requiring preprocessing.
- **Rare searches**: suitable for infrequent searches to keep it simple.
- **Dynamic data**: effective when data is frequently updated.
- **Specific applications**: great for simplicity in teaching or embedded systems.
